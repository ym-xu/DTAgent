Similar to other rural churches, Zion Lutheran has been the focal point of the surrounding German settlement for decades and is a noteworthy structure. The area was settled by Germans and the first church was erected in 1877. This church was replaced in 1885 with another structure which burned in 1896.  $^{31}$  The present Zion Lutheran Church was dedicated in 1897 and is part of a rural religious complex, which includes a cemetery, church, parsonage, and school. The exterior of the church was altered in 1972 when a new foyer was added, but the interior retains much of its original character. A large U- shaped balcony wraps around three sides of the nave and pressed tin is found throughout the building.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Great Plains scholar Bradley Baltensperger (1985) contends that \"disputes over county seats were the wars of frontier Nebraska. Fraudulent elections to select a county seat might be followed by theft of the county records, showdowns, court battles, and more thefts of records.\"56 To a large degree, Hamilton County\\'s eventual selection of Aurora matches Baltensperger\\'s description. Orville City, which had been surveyed and recorded in 1870 and located on the West Blue River, was selected in 1871 as Hamilton County\\'s first seat of government. That distinction would not last long. Soon after establishing Orville City in the county\\'s southeastern portion as the county seat, a group of citizens started to protest the selection, calling for a more central location. In the \"first election Aurora received over two- thirds of the votes cast, which was the necessary majority at that time, but the commissioners would not order the removal\" because the results were deemed illegal.57 Another vote was held in 1874, where 399- 1/2 votes were required for victory. In that contest Aurora collected 399 votes, Hamilton 147, and Orville City just 53. By law, Aurora had failed to meet the required number; however, Aurora \"imprudently organized a company of some 150 of her citizens and friends and went to Orville City, and by violence and force took possession of the county court house and loaded up the records and cafes and brought them to Aurora.\"58 A \"writ of mandamus compelled them to be taken back to the county seat the following spring.\"59 Soon thereafter, Darius Wilcox (one of Aurora\\'s original town founders) visited Lincoln and successfully lobbied the state legislature to change the requirement to three- fifths of votes cast to change county seats. In May a special election was called, although by this time Hamilton, Nebraska, was making a legitimate challenge for the county seat. County historian Bremer (1967) refers to Hamilton as Aurora\\'s \"bitter enemy\" and the \"strongest contender in the three- cornered contest\" for county seat.60 In the May election Aurora won by a small majority and in June another election was held and Hamilton won by a slim margin. The fifth and final vote based on a pure majority (half plus one) was held in October of 1875. At this election, Aurora received 481 votes and Hamilton 400; hence, Aurora officially became the seat of government in early 1876. Soon after the election Hamilton and Orville both merged with Aurora, and Hamilton quickly became a \"deserted village.\"61'},\n",
